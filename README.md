# MouseCallbacks
This project is an application of mouse callback methods in OpenCV.

It works as follows:
<br>
SINGLE LEFT CLICK: GIVES COORDINATE OF PIXEL ON WHICH MOUSE IS POINTING
<br>
SINGLE RIGHT CLICK: GIVES COLOR OF PIXEL(IN BGR FORMAT) ON WHICH MOUSE IS POINTING
<br>
DOUBLE LEFT CLICK: GIVES LINE FROM PREVIOUS DOUBLE LEFT CLICKED PIXEL TO THE CURRENT DOUBLE LEFT CLICKED PIXEL
<br>
DOUBLE RIGHT CLICK: GIVES COLOR OF PIXEL(IN BGR FORMAT) AND DISPLAYS COLOR IN ANOTHER WINDOW
